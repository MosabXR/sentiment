I’ve been using a new pair of wireless earbuds for a couple of weeks now. They connect to my phone via Bluetooth, and the setup process was quick and easy. The sound quality is decent, with clear audio for music and podcasts, though the bass isn’t particularly strong. They come with a charging case that holds enough power for a few recharges, and the earbuds themselves last about five hours on a single charge. The fit is comfortable for short periods, but I notice some discomfort after wearing them for a few hours. They have a built-in microphone for calls, which works fine in quiet environments but picks up some background noise outdoors. The controls are touch-based and take some getting used to.

The earbuds are a practical choice for everyday use, like commuting or working out. They’re not the best I’ve tried, but they’re not bad either—just a solid, middle-of-the-road option. I use them regularly and haven’t encountered any major issues, but there’s nothing especially remarkable about them either.
